Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds \u2014 from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences \u2014 so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.\n\nAbout the Team:\n\nBecause Quora is such a data-driven company, our data scientists play a central role in the product development process by uncovering key insights from our data. As a data scientist, you'll work closely with engineers, product designers, and product managers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, design randomized controlled experiments, build visualizations, and tackle hard, open-ended problems. You'll also develop tools and infrastructure to scale and automate the analyses that enable rapid product iteration. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. We use a variety of tools -- primarily Python and SQL \u2014 to analyze data and communicate results with the rest of the company.\n\nWhile Quora's data scientists come from a variety of backgrounds, including statistics, computer science, economics, physics, mathematics, sociology, chemical engineering, and so on, we all share a love for data and continuous learning. Especially in your first role post-graduation, we realize that mentorship is important for professional growth and development. Every data scientist has a mentor and weekly 1:1s with their managers to get feedback and support for your career growth.\n\nTo give you a taste of what data scientists at Quora do, here are some example projects:\n\nAnalyze traffic patterns to similar questions and understand the metric implications of duplicate questions\n\nForecast growth trajectory of Quora in different languages and identify growth bottlenecks and drivers\n\nEvaluate long term effects of a ranking algorithm change beyond short term metric gains as shown in experiments\n\nDevise metrics and build dashboards to measure the success of a new product feature or initiative\n\nExplain suspicious metric spikes as measured by dashboards and A/B tests\n\nMake trade-off and recommend product decisions when a key metric improves but another one drops in an A/B test\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nExtract actionable insights from broad, open-ended questions to influence product strategy and drive roadmap decisions\n\nAnalyze data to understand the root causes of metric movements and uncover growth opportunities\n\nDesign and evaluate A/B tests to make informed recommendations on product changes\n\nDevelop metrics and create dashboards to orient the direction of product development and track the success of the product\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\nB.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in a scientific or quantitative field\n\nProficiency in using SQL and procedural programming languages (e.g. Python, R) to manipulate and analyze data\n\nRigorous coursework in statistical techniques (e.g. hypothesis testing, regression)\n\nRelevant past internship or research experience working with large data sets and experiments\n\nDemonstrated ability to exercise judgment and combine quantitative skills with product judgment to translate numbers into insights\n\nDemonstrated ability to clearly explain data results to cross-functional teams\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n\nExperience in working with large data sets and distributed computing tools (Hive, Redshift)\n\nExperience pushing code and navigating a complex codebase\n\nActive Quora user with curiosity about the product\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nCheck out these resources (all on Quora!) to learn more.\n\nQuora Data Science Team Session:\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/session/Data-Science/1 Quora data scientists answered a bunch of questions on Quora.\n\nOur Blog:\n\nCheck out some of the things we've written up to share: https://www.quora.com/q/quoradata\n\nMachine Learning Engineer vs. Data Scientist:\n\nThis is a commonly asked question.

Snorkel started as a research project in the Stanford AI Lab in 2016, creating a higher-level interface to machine learning through programmatically labeled and managed training data. From deploying in some of the world\u2019s largest and most sophisticated tech organizations, to empowering scientists, doctors, and journalists \u2014 we\u2019ve seen firsthand how this approach democratizes and accelerates AI. Now, we\u2019re building Snorkel Flow to bring our technology to everyone!\n\nBuilding Snorkel Flow requires outstanding engineers and technologies across the stack, including scalable data pipelines, elegant and intuitive interfaces (both visual and programmatic), state-of-the-art ML modeling techniques, and best practices for seamless deployment. Modern AI approaches require large labeled training datasets to learn from. While traditional approaches typically rely on armies of human annotators to label by hand, Snorkel Flow empowers users to programmatically label and build training data sets to drive a radically faster, more flexible, and higher quality end-to-end AI development process. Snorkel Flow is an end-to-end development platform, complete with a GUI and powerful programmatic interfaces for driving the development process for full AI application workflows: from preprocessing, to programmatic training data creation, to ML model training, to analysis, and deployment. It's the data-first platform for enterprise AI.\n\nExcited to help us redefine how AI applications are built?
